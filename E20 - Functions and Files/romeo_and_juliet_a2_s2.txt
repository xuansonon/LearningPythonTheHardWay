ROMEO
  (aside) She speaks.
  O, speak again, bright angel! For thou art
  As glorious to this night, being o'er my head,
  As is a wingèd messenger of heaven
  Unto the white, upturnèd, wondering eyes
  Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
  When he bestrides the lazy-puffing clouds
  And sails upon the bosom of the air.

JULIET
  O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo?
  Deny thy father and refuse thy name.
  Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
  And I’ll no longer be a Capulet.
